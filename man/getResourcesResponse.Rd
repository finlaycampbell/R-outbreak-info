\item{fields}{(optional) vector specifying which fields to return. Returns all by default}

\item{sort}{(optional) field to sort by.  Add `-` to sort in descending order}

\item{facets}{(optional) field by which to aggregate (count) their frequency}

\item{facet_size}{(optional) how many facet groups to include in the facet total (default = 10, max = 1000)}

\item{query}{(optional) constructs a query over ALL fields, or a fielded query searching within specific fields. Fielded query terms should be separated by ` AND ` or ` OR `.
